## FAQs

- Will I ever update this?
> I don't know. I've built this to test my basic understanding of my MERN stack skills. I may choose to make a different app to test out other features before I update this.

- Does it have a frontend?
> Yes. Please head to [Sample React Todo App](https://github.com/talktoacomputer/react-query-sample-crud). I've built this FE to test out `react-query` [library](https://tanstack.com/query/v4), so don't expect much.
